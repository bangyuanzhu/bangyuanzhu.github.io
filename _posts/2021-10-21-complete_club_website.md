Really interested in creating a new website! (But It cannot be shared unless using NTU VPN :(  )<br>

Besides, I also think about my future recently. I REALLY do not want to work directly just after my graduation. It seems like the government just treats us like blue collars. For me, to devote myself to scientific research is the happiest career. <br>

This is one way to achieve my life goal: To be unique and outstanding. I still hold the line even I have lost and been beaten many times. I prefer to die if I become a mediocre person, work from day to night, fall into love and marriage, do as most people do.<br>

To achieve the goal, the requirements are strict: I have to do much better than others to prove that I am really talented. Meanwhile, currently, it is uncomfortable for me if I do something different and others might give me a strange look. I always doubt my choice and become hesitant when this sh*t happens. These are two main things that I need to overcome.<br>

Hope I can make my life meaningful, otherwise, I have no difference with orangutan. <br>
