After experiencing so many internship jobs, I finally found it was the least 'boring' industry.<br>

No meaningless document writing, no serval hours even days waiting for LLM trained, there is only one fascinating goal: To develop strategies to earn money in the market. When I saw my yield ratio of the strategy is like a 45-degree diagonal line straight upward in the backtesting system, I can really feel that adrenaline is being generated inside my body.<br>

Originally, the huge wage of Quant attracts me to change profession. Then I realized that working can also causes passion. Hope that I could pass those strict qualification trials and become a real Quant.<br>
