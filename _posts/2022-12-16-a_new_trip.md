Being addicted to competitive programming is the best way to torture myself.<br>

I could not deny that it was helpful, but as time passed, I sorrowfully found that it was the proof to tell me that I was neither talented nor hard-working.<br>

Luckily, this experience could provide me with a new journey. Although I am just a beginner at machine learning, I can see them behind every formula and code. They never left, they became part of me.<br>

Bless to my new future.<br>
